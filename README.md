# 1603 Paper Solutions

This repository contains Sem2 2023 solutions. This is a follow up to the Comp1602 past paper practise repo I worked on with Paul Taylor.

## Usage

Each past paper is organized by `year/month`, and each question is in the form qN, where N is the question number. The past paper in PDF format can also be found in the corresponding `year/month` folder.

## Why do some solutions use recursion extensively?

Many students struggle with recursion, so some solutions were designed to be recursive to help improve their understanding and mastery of this concept.

# What are the "new", "boolalpha" and other functions used for in some of the solutions?

These functions are not directly related to the problems being solved and are used to generate sample outputs in the main function. <br/>

The "new" keyword is used to dynamically allocate memory for nodes in linked lists, while the "boolalpha" function is used to print Boolean values as "true" or "false". <br/>

These functions are not covered in the course syllabus but are useful for convenient sample outputs.
